To run on a similar Linux environment:
-->  ./rustinr

To run on a similar cargo environment:
-->  cargo run

Anywhere else with an appropriate environment:
-->  01_cnvt
followed by one of the above.

===================================================================

This directory contains the result of:

(1) Copy the contents of the neighbouring src directory to here.

(2) Build the ginr executable under the supervision of bear. This results in
a json file that describes the build process.

(3) Run the c2rust transpiler to convert the individual 'c' files to 'rust'.

(4) Run cargo build to compile the rust and produce a binary. Move the binary
from the target directory to the current directory as 'rustinr'. Alternatively,
use 'cargo run'

There are a lot of warnings that need to be looked at but the executable
appears to run correctly.

===================================================================

IMPORTANT FILES:

01_cnvt: runs all of the necessary programs in an appropriately set up
environment including rust, bear, and c2rust plus dependencies.

rustinr: an executable runable (on an environment similar to where it was
built).

*.rs, Cargo.* c2rust-lib.rs rust-toolchain: files necessary for cargo build
to run properly.
